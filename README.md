# ASL-Recognition-With-CNN


$\hspace{1cm}$

This project's purpose is bringing a AI solution to the American Sign Language Recognition, to achieve this ; 

$\hspace{1cm}$

$\Rightarrow$ I downloaded the data associated with American Sign Language images  

$\hspace{1cm}$

$\Rightarrow$ I preprocessed the data for make the data reusable and efficent to train

$\hspace{1cm}$

$\Rightarrow$ I find the optimal neural network architecture and it's hyperparameters to achieve more accurate results 

$\hspace{1cm}$

$\Rightarrow$ I trained the model after obtaining the best architecture and it's best hyperparameters which hitted %91.25 validation accuracy.

$\hspace{1cm}$

$\Rightarrow$ I load and save my model, and test it on real life examples which are my own hand gestures !

$\hspace{1cm}$

This whole process is created by making good visiluizations about data itself and model's accuracy on the data.

$\hspace{1cm}$

In conclusion, I achieved my goal. In my future projects, I want to develop my idea and my techniques to bring better solutions for the same problem. Stay tuned!
